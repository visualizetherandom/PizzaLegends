### Pizza Legends - A JavaScript Game Tutorial

This repository is for my fork of an original project by Drew Conley
as seen on YouTube. In addition to learning some JavaScript, I've
also used it as a basis for practicing git and github.

Feel free to fork this yourself if you're interested in the code.
I cannot promise that I'll pull your changes since I'm not really
focused on maintaining a project right now. :)

Drew's original project code is on Google Drive. Check out [his
YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcjhmZ8oLT0r9dSiIK6RB_PuBWlG1KSq_) for details.
